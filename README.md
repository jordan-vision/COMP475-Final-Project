# FinalProject
 
TODO:

Scene graph
- Audio group
    - Sound sources and their visual representation (speakers / instruments)
    - Object position = spatialization
    - Object rotation
        - yaw = volume
        - pitch = reverb?
        - roll = filter?
- Stage group & UI group
    - Coordinate system
    - Buttons
    - Speaker icons

User interface
- Allow user to pick up and move sound sources
    - No physics, allow objects to stay in place
- Allow object locking

Collaborative performance
- Synchronize audio group
- Unique stage/UI group for each user
    - E.g. randomize textures of stage
